So yesterday, I set up Ghost Blog on a VPS from Google Cloud. I spent hours trying to decide on which theme to choose, writing my about me, and drawing photos (Yes, these shitty drawings take me a while to finish). Little did I know all of this progress would be lost the next day. 

Ironically, the first blog post I had published was titled "Get away from me Google!". It was a very vague tutorial on how to avoid using Google applications. *Now that's besides the point*, the next day I woke up excited to see how my blog post was doing and I popped open a browser on my phone (I have 23 different browsers on my phone). I quickly type in "*pwnable.club*" into FireFox, only to be left with 1 minute of loading. At this point, I kind of realized that something had happened to my blog.

I just assumed the Ghost Blog service had crashed, so I hopped on my computer (No I didn't actually hop on my computer, it would break) and *tried* to ssh into my non-existent VPS. After that failed, I frantically go to the Google Cloud control panel and get a message reading **exactly** thi- well actually here's a screenshot:

No but seriously. The message pretty much said that they had *suspected* me of doing something illegal on my VPS.
Which isn't true, I never used the VPS for ***ANYTHING*** illegal. They said I could file a ticket to retrieve my VPS again, but I wasn't going to go through all that bullshit, when they couldn't even give me a solid explanation as to what *illegal* thing I did. So I packed my bags and forgot about it. At this point, I completely gave up on making a blog anymore, but then I realized something. **THAT I'M NO LOSER! SO I GOT UP AND TOLD MYSELF I WOULD GET BACK TO CODING AND WRITING A NEW BLOG NO MATTER WHAT!** Then I sat back down because who the hell codes standing up.

Anyways the moral of the story is, **FUCK GOOGLE!**
